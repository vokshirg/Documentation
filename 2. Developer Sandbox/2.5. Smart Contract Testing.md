This chapter covers guidelines for SDK testing.
## Using TestRPC in the SDK 
If you use DAO.Casino SDK and install it from Trufflebox or use our DC-CLI application, you get TestRPC  (uses [Ganache CLI](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache )) deployed automatically.
It is displayed in the **test** folder of the SDK console.

TESTRPC includes a fixed number of accounts and private keys. The image below shows testing process in the environment operated by dc-cli.

If you want to deploy it on your own, read the section below.

## Deploying Testing Environment On Your Own

To test smart contracts, Truffle framework is used.  [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle) v.2 uses JavaScript for test development, Mocha and Chai libraries are used. v.3 also supports Solidity.

This framework represents an appropriate tool for testing Ethereum-based smart contracts. Contract logic is implemented via specific methods regulating the way contract state is changed and how events are triggered. Existing smart-contract debugging techniques are weak, and, once a contract is deployed online, its code cannot be revised. The only remedy is contract elimination and replacement with a new one.  Therefore, thorough testing is a must, especially, as far as payment methods are concerned.

1. To install Truffle, run: `npm install -g Truffle`
2. Launch the develop mode :`truffle develop`
3. Then, in develop mode run command

```javascript
compile

...contract compile...

test
```

Also, testing environment is deployed. The recommended client is [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc). Alternatively, you can use a standard client (e.g.: Parity) in [dev mode](https://github.com/paritytech/parity) with immediate transaction validation. 

1. To deploy TestRPC testing environment via npm, enter command: 


   ```javascript
   npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
   ```

*Note that TestRPC is to be launched at a separate terminal. At each launch the client generates 10 new accounts, each having funds deposited.*
