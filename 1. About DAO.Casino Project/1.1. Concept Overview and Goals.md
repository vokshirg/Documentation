# What is DAO.Сasino?

## Overview

DAO.Casino is an interaction protocol designed to resolve key on-line gambling issues:

- Fraud from on-line casinos
- Inexistent tools to check the draw result
- Hidden and unreasonable fees
- Lowering entry-level for game developers 
- High casino operation costs and overheads (in particular, payment and balance management integration)

The protocol is created to build and regulate interactions between the following human and machine agents:

1. Game developers
2. Players
3. Platform Owners
4. Bankroll Backer
5. Referrers
6. Autonomous agents

Basically, DAO.Casino offers a virtual environment where the above parties can cowork in any combination to set up an online casino at minimum cost. 

From the very start, participants get:

- an automated value distribution protocol represented by a system of Ethereum contracts (''smart contracts") that applies a set of incentives
- a generator of equally unpredictable pseudo-random numbers for games
- DAO.Casino "chips" represented by its own token DAO.Casino BET Token
- a js-based SDK with detailed guidelines 

Game front-end can be stored either on the server or on the network using decentralized file storage systems (e.g. IPFS or Ethereum’s native Swarm). Note that Swarm supports games programmed to use income to pay storage fees.

# What Makes DAO.Сasino Unique?

## Decentralized operation

 In DAO.Casino, decentralization is key to establishing a P2P marketplace where participants do not have trust each other. Actually, that's where the the name DAO comes from: Decentralized Autonomous Organization. 

Thanks to the implementation of smart contracts operating as autonomous agents, rewards are distributed automatically to all key parties: game developers, referrers, platform operators and PRNG suppliers. Apart from eliminating the need of a trusted third party, smart contracts also enable crowd-funding of bankroll in every game. Moreover, they stimulate community-driven security audit. DAO.Casino smart-contracts based on the appropriate PRNG method represent our MVP.

While DAO.Casino protocol still requires a fee system,  fee distribution is  hardcoded, excluding hidden fees.

## Easy G2M

DAO.Casino offers flexible business launch and operation options to all players of the online gambling market:

- game developers can use the ready-made protocol and get down to creating new games faster and at lower cost    
- casino operators can offer higher security to players for smaller fees
- players benefit from a wider range of games 
- access to versatile business models where parties can operate as independent entities,  as coworkers or can merge (e.g.: platform operator, casino owner and developer can be the same entity).

Despite of Gas cost that is required for Ethereum powered software to run, the fees should remain lower than in traditional server based online gambling. This is because the gas is paid per operation, and only for the operations and storage that is used.

## Developer-Friendly SDK

DAO.Casino relies of Docker and Truffle environments to provide a friendly SDK. 

Deployment takes minutes; basic game development requires no additional integration, as containers have built-in bankroller core, smart-contract and protocol components. 

While DAO.Casino offers flexible and varied deployment options. The easisest is based on our own command line interface; to reduce the risk of errors and human factor, we minimized the number of entry points, simplified structure, as well as implemented a cutting edge toolkit.  

# How Does DAO.Сasino Work?

## Smart Contracts for Fair Play

At the most vulnerable point where a trusted third party would be required to transfer funds we put a bunch of code consistently executed by the Ethereum network; we call it "smart contracts". To put it plainly, these contracts are just escrows triggered only by specific participant actions to generate value in the game environment. With the human involvement eliminated, there is no more risk of fraud and corruption.

## Trustworthy Dealer

In DAO.Casino, equal unpredictability of game outcomes is determined by PRNG which ensures fairness of the game. Currently the protocol relies on [DAO.Casino's own version](https://github.com/DaoCasino/Documentation/1.%20About%20Dao.Casino/1.2.%20Detailed%20Algorithm%20Specification.md) of the [Signidice algorithm](https://github.com/gluk256/misc/blob/master/rng4ethereum/signidice.md) by [gluk256](https://github.com/gluk256) for PRNG in deterministic virtual machine, namely for Ethereum-based games using Ether. 

We adapted the method to use our DAO.Casino BET token which replaces the initial "Ether bounty".

Other  methods, in particular, those using Oraclize and internal blockchain data, have also been tested by the team. Although viable, these failed to demonstrate adequate security level. Therefore, we decided to work out a custom Signdice instance in Solidity.

## Offchain Gambling
To avoid additional Ethereum fees and to keep adequate game speed, the game logic is implemented both within the game smart contract (Ropsten) and within an offchain script (implemented via IPFS deployment). The game script operates during the whole game, while the contract is only called at the start and at the end of each gambling session (or in case of dispute (see the chapter on [Game Channels](https://github.com/DaoCasino/Documentation/2.%20Developer%20Sandbox/2.7.%20Payment%20Channel%20Configuration.md)) to verify fairness). 

## Solution Components 

1. [SDK](https://github.com/DaoCasino) that integrates game logic, interaction logic (channel state), smart contracts, randomizer, testing. 
2. [Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/daocasino/dashboard/) for seamless SDK and back-end deployment.
3. [DC-CLI](https://github.com/DaoCasino/Documentation/2.%20Developer%20Sandbox/2.2.%20DC-CLI%20and%20Dev%20Environment.md) wizard for seamless SDK installation.  
4. DAO.Casino BET Token


# Protocol Requirements & Limitations

Current version of DAO.Casino is designed only for single-step games of chance involving two sides or two players, for example, heads or tails, roulette, dice, shell game, rock-paper-scissors, etc.
